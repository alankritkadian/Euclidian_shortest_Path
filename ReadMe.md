## Shortest Path Finding in the Presence of Polygonal Obstacles

Welcome to the ADA (Algorithms and Data Structures) project of Group 15! This project focuses on finding the shortest path from a starting point to a target point in the presence of polygonal obstacles.

### Project Overview:

The objective of this project is to implement an algorithm that efficiently calculates the shortest path between a given starting point and a target point while considering the presence of polygonal obstacles. The algorithm takes into account the geometry of the obstacles to ensure a realistic path is generated.

### Instructions to Run:

To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Open the `main.py` file in your preferred text editor.

2. Locate the section in the code where polygon points are defined. It typically looks like this:

   ```python
   # Define polygon points here
   polys = [
       [Polygon1],[Polygon2]
       # ... add more polygons as needed
   ]
   ```

   Manually update the `polys` list with the coordinates of your polygonal obstacles.

5. Save the changes to `main.py`.

6. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.

7. Run the following command to execute the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

8. Follow the on-screen prompts to input the starting point and target point.

9. The program will then calculate and display the shortest path considering the specified polygonal obstacles.
